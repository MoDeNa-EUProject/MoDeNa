# Foaming simulation
Collection of software tools for the simulation of polyurethane (PU) foaming
process. Based on a recipe the model predicts the evolution of chemical
kinetics, temperature, foam density, bubble size distribution, etc.
This directory includes the foaming process in zero dimensional and three
dimensional spaces. Additionally, a wall drainage simulation can be performed, which estimates the size and shape of strut and wall thickness profile. In order to run a test case, firstly the source codes should
be compiled. The script `build` compiles the necessary models. The surrogate
models will be loaded into the database by executing the two scripts provided:
`initModels` and `initBubbleGrowth`. Finally, the scripts `workflow*` run the
simulations and detailed model for bubble growth.

# Dependencies and Installation
Several models need to be compiled. C++ and Fortran compilers are required.
First the MoDeNa framework should be compiled.
The [following steps](https://github.com/MoDeNa-EUProject/MoDeNa) describe how
to install MoDeNa framework.

### 1. Install OpenFOAM
The CFD solver is compiled with OpenFOAM 4.0 on Ubuntu 16.04. In order to install OpenFOAM, you can either follow the steps in [OpenFOAM](http://openfoam.org/download/4-0-ubuntu/) website or
copy/paste the commands below which install OpenFOAM and ParaView:

```
sudo add-apt-repository http://dl.openfoam.org/ubuntu
sudo sh -c "wget -O - http://dl.openfoam.org/gpg.key | apt-key add -"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install openfoam4
mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN
mkdir -p $FOAM_USER_APPBIN
mkdir -p $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN
```
*Note 1*: This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6BWTEcuh38) demonstrates the installation process.

make
```
Export variables in `.bashrc`

export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-debug
```
### 5. Install rapidjson library

cd where-you-want-source-files
git clone https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson.git
cd rapidjson
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```
### 6. Install fson library
The library is installed to `{HOME}/lib` and `{HOME}/include`
```
cd where-you-want-source-files
git clone https://github.com/japaf/fson.git
cd fson
cmake .
make
make install
```
### 7. Install bspline library
The library is installed to `{HOME}/lib` and `{HOME}/include`
```
cd where-you-want-source-files
git clone https://github.com/japaf/bspline-fortran.git
cd bspline-fortran
cmake .
make
make install
```
### 8. Install sundials library
```
cd where-you-want-source-files
git clone https://github.com/luca-heltai/sundials.git
cd sundials
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DFCMIX_ENABLE=ON -DLAPACK_ENABLE=ON ..
make
sudo make install
```
### 9. Set the environmental variables for MoDeNa
```
user=$(whoami)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/${user}/OpenFOAM/${user}-2.3.0/platforms/linux64GccDPDebug/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:-}:${HOME}/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH:-}:${HOME}/lib/python2.7/site-packages
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-}:${HOME}/lib/python2.7/site-packages:${HOME}/lib/modena:/usr/local/lib

```
### 10. Compile the models
```
./build
```
Please note that the output of build should not contain any error messages.
Otherwise, the tool cannot work properly.

# Run
In order to execute the program, you need to first provide the input variables
for all the modelling tools. In the `examples` directory several cases have
been provided. One can copy the `inputs` directory into the `foamExpansion` and
modify it for the targeted recipe. The `unifiedInput.json` provides the input
data for the bubble growth model and zero dimensional simulation, `wallDrainage_inputs.json` provides the inputs for the wall drainage simulation, `init_foamConductivity.json` provides initial points for the initialization of foamConductivity and the rest of input directory
creates the test case for OpenFOAM simulation. The details of the input
variables have been elaborated in `INPUTS.md`. After preparing the inputs the following
steps should be executed:

1. Initialize surrogate nano-scale models:
```
./initModels
```

    *Note:* foamConductivity takes initial points from `init_foamConductivity.json`. This file can be prepared using `prep_init_foamConductivity.py`.
2.  Execute meso-scopic bubble growth simulation:
```
./workflow_bubbleGrowth
```
3. Initialize surrogate bubble growth model:
```
./initBubbleGrowth
```
4. Run macroscopic simulation (0D or 3D):
```
./workflow_0D
```
or
```
./workflow_3D
```
    *Note:*

    - In case of any changes in the input files steps 2-4 should repeated.

    - Initial moments of the bubble size distribution can be calculated by running
    `initMoments`. This script uses the mean, variance and initial number
    density of bubbles from `unifiedInput.json`.

    - If the following error occurs:
    ```
         --> FOAM FATAL ERROR:
         Wrong number of arguments, expected 0 found 1

         FOAM exiting

         cannot find system Renviron
         Fatal error: unable to open the base package
    ```
    The workaround is to set the R environment variable as below:
    ```
    R_HOME=/usr/lib/R (where you have installed R)
    export R_HOME=/usr/lib/R
    ```

- The wall drainage simulation can be executed anytime after running the `./workflow_bubbleGrowth` by:
```
./workflow_wallDrainage
```

# Results
Results of the last simulation are stored in the corresponding sub-directory of
the `results` directory. We use VEUSZ to visualize some of the
results. For example, to look at selected results for a 0D
simulation, you can open `plotQmom0D.vsz` using VEUSZ. Further, the results of
the 3D simulation (stored in the launcher directory) can be displayed using a
third party software such as [paraview.](http://www.paraview.org/) Additional results can be displayed through python scripts like `plotWallDrainage.py`.
