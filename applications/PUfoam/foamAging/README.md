## Aging of polyurethane foam thermal properties
### Physical background
PU foam is blown by CO2 and cyclo-pentane. In time, CO2 is
diffusing out of the foam, whereas air is diffusing into the foam. CO2 has
lower thermal conductivity than air. Thus, thermal conductivity of the foam is
increasing in time.

### Model
Mathematical models in this software simulate the diffusion of gases through
the foam and estimate thermal properties of the foam based on its morphology
and and composition of gases in the cells.

## Installation
LAPACK and BLAS libraries are required. You can install them in Ubuntu using:
```
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
```
Compile the detailed models using:
```
./build
```
Append path to the models directory to "PYTHONPATH":
```
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:../Models"
```

### (Optional)
Some results can be easily visualized using [VEUSZ](http://home.gna.org/veusz/)
program. It can be installed in Ubuntu using:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jeremysanders/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install veusz
```

## Run
First, prepare input file **input.in**. Example input can be found in
"example inputs" folder. Use only constant solubility. Detailed model is not
present. Load all surrogate models and their parameters to database:
```
./initModels
```
Main simulation:
```
./workflow
```

## Results
The "results" folder contains a file with time dependence of equivalent
conductivity "keq_time.out" and files with concentration profiles.
The evolution of equivalent conductivity can be viewed using "keq_time.vsz"
script and VEUSZ. Concentration profiles can be viewed using "degas_plot.py".
