 
# Surface Tension

## Scope of this module
The surface tension module returns the surface tension of a fluid system in equilibrium with coexisting 
liquid and vapor phases. The module consists of two main components: 

* The detailed model
* The surrogate model

A PC-SAFT based density functional theory is used as the detailed model. See this [publication](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jcp/131/20/10.1063/1.3263124) 
for more details of this model. However, here we use a modification which is computationally less demanding and can be applied to systems of more
than two components. The detailed model takes temperature as input. Pressure is set to one bar in all calculations.
The output of the model is the surface tension of the system. 

Since surface tension shows an almost perfectly linear temperature dependence, the surrogate model is 
a simple linear equation in temperature:
$\gamma(T) = A + BT $ 
where A and B are adjustable parameters.

A nonlinear least-squares algorithm is used to determine the optimal values of these parameters in order to correlate the 
results of the detailed model as closely as possible. 


## Prerequisites
In order to compile and run the module a fortran compiler, preferably gfortran, as well as PETSc 3.4.5 need to be installed. 
As there is no backward compatibility of different versions of PETSc, older as well as newer version of PETSc will most likely not work.


## Installing PETSc
PETSc should be configured with the following options:
./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-fc=gfortran --download-f-blas-lapack --download-mpich --download-scalapak=yes
Furthermore, the variables PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH need to be set.

## Compiling and running the detailed model code

* Compilation: make DFT
* Execution: make run_mf


## Input / Output

Module inputs:

* Temperature (Kelvin)

Module outputs:

* Surface Tension (mN/m)

## Workflow

On initialisation of the module, the surrogate model parameters are adjusted to the initial data points which have to be set in the module prior to 
program execution. Subsequently, as long as the input temperatures do not fall outside this initial temperature intervall, only the surrogate model
is evaluated at a model call. Once the module is called with a temperature outside this intervall, new data points are generated according to
the *out of bounds strategy* which also needs to be specified in the module and the parameters of the surrogate model are readjusted.
