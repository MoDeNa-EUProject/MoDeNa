This has been achieved by using x-ray computed tomography (CT) and surface strain mapping to determine the deformation modes and the cell morphologies that control the onset of yielding. The deformation is found to localize in narrow bands having width of order of a cell diameter. Outside the bands, the material remains elastic. The cells within the bands that experience large permanent strains are primarily elliptical. A group of cells work collectively to allow large localized deformation. Size does not appear to be the initiator of the deformation bands. Equiaxed cells remain elastic. The implications for manufacturing materials with superior mechanical properties are discussed. Visualization of internal deformation of a closed cell Al alloy core, as part of a sandwich panel construction, is also possible using x-ray tomography.

The cell size and cell wall thickness distributions of the foam were measured from microscope images. The Young’s modulus of cell wall material of the foam was characterised by nanoindentation tests. It is found that when the cell size and cell wall thickness are assumed to be uniform in the models, the Kelvin, Weaire–Phelan and Laguerre models overpredict the stiffness of the foam. However, the Young’s modulus and shear modulus predicted by the Laguerre models incorporating measured foam cell size and cell wall thickness distributions agree well with the experimental data. This emphasizes the fact that the integration of realistic cell wall and cell size variations is vital for foam modelling. Subsequently the effects of cell size and cell wall thickness variations on the stiffness of closed-cell foams were investigated using Laguerre models. It is found that the Young’s modulus and shear modulus decrease with increasing cell size and cell wall thickness variations. The degree of stiffness variation of closed-cell foams resulting from the cell size dispersion and cell wall thickness dispersion are comparable. There is little interaction between the cell size variation and cell wall thickness variation as far as their effects on foam moduli are concerned. Based on the simulation results, expressions incorporating cell size and cell wall thickness variations were formulated for predicting the stiffness of closed-cell foams. Lastly, a simple spring system model was proposed to explain the effects of cell size and cell wall thickness variations on the stiffness of cellular structures. "

pages="1547--1555",
abstract="The deformation behaviour of an open-cell flexible polyurethane foam was observed using X-ray microtomography on the ID19 beamline at the ESRF in Grenoble, France. Tomographs, consisting of 1024 voxels cubed, were collected with a voxel size of 6.6 $\mu$m from a small region near the centre of the foam at a range of compressive strains between 0 and 80{\%}. The results show that the initial stages of compression are taken up by small amounts of elastic bending in struts that are inclined to the compression direction. At 23{\%} strain, entirely collapsed bands were observed in the structure. By 63{\%} strain, there was evidence of struts impinging on each other, corresponding to the densification regime. The compression of an irregular foam (i.e. one with strut length and cell size distributions) appears to involve a sudden change in modulus, accompanied by localised increases in density. Observations of this nature would have been extremely difficult to interpret unambiguously without the ability to carry out sequential microtomographic imaging under realistic in situ loading conditions. The process of finite element analysis (FEA) was begun by constructing node-strut models from the experimental data by a mathematical skeletonisation process. These were used to derive node coordination, strut-length and cell-size distributions. However, direct comparison of the elastic properties with FEA was hampered by the absence of periodicity in the experimentally determined foam structures.",

The volumes of spheres are set to serve lognormal distribution, which is strongly inherited by distribution of cell volumes in the RCP-LV diagram. The geometrical and topological properties in the RCP-LV diagram and the Poisson-Voronoi diagram (PV diagram) are compared with those properties of real polycrystalline materials, and it is found that the lognormal distribution is a better approximation to the cell volume and face number distribution in the RCP-LV diagram than in the PV diagram. It is also shown clearly that coefficient of variance of cell volumes in the RCP-LV diagram is controlled by coefficient of variance of sphere volumes. This makes it easy to simulate polycrystalline microstructure with different dispersion of grain volumes. The RCP-LV diagram is probably superior to the PV diagram for the simulation of polycrystalline materials.},

The modeling is based on the anisotropic Kelvin foam developed in Part I assigned the same general geometric characteristics. It is demonstrated that the first knee observed in measured responses is associated with the onset of ligament buckling. Models involving either single or stacks of fully periodic characteristic cells are used to establish the critical stresses in the rise and transverse foam directions. In the rise direction the critical state involves a long wavelength mode whereas in the transverse direction the mode is local to the cell. Postbuckling calculations involving these modes showed the rise direction response to exhibit a limit load which is shown to be imperfection sensitive. The response in the transverse direction is monotonically increasing as observed in the experiments. The crushing response is evaluated by considering finite size microsections which allow localized deformation to develop. Localized crushing is arrested by contact between the ligaments of the buckled cells. Contact is approximated by limiting the amount a cell can collapse in the direction of the applied load. This arrests local collapse and causes it to spread to neighboring material at a nearly constant stress level as in the experiments. The stress picks up when the whole domain has crushed. "

Apparent elastic modulus and compliance tensors denned through the energetic procedure on a single specimen are considered. Through a variational approach, it is shown that each of them is bounded on one side. For cases fulfilling the Hill condition, these apparent modulus and compliance tensors are reciprocals. This provides two-sided bounds on each one. In this case, for a body smaller than the representative volume, the apparent elasticity tensor for mixed boundary conditions falls between the tensors associated with the static and kinematic uniform boundary conditions. Illustrating examples are studied. Various possible fields of application and other extensions are considered."

The cells are irregular polyhedra with anywhere from 9 to 17 faces in nearly monodisperse foams. The material is concentrated in the nearly straight ligaments and in the nodes where they intersect. The mechanical properties of such foams are governed by their microstructure and by the properties of the base material. In this study micro-computed X-ray tomography is used to develop 3D images of the morphology of polyester urethane and Duocel aluminum foams with different average cell sizes. The images are used to establish statistically the cell size and ligament length distributions, material distributions along the ligaments, the geometry of the nodes and cell anisotropy. The measurements are then used to build finite element foam models of increasing complexity that are used to estimate the elastic moduli. In the most idealized model the microstructure is represented as a regular Kelvin cell. The most realistic models are based on Surface Evolver simulations of random soap froth with \{N3\} cells in spatially periodic domains. In all models the cells are elongated in one direction, the ligaments are straight but have a nonuniform cross sectional area distribution and are modeled as shear deformable beams. With this input both the Kelvin cell models and the larger random foam models are shown to predict the elastic moduli with good accuracy but the random foams are 5–10% stiffer. "

In the first family of models, the foams are idealized as anisotropic Kelvin cells loaded in the &lt;100&gt; direction and in the second family more realistic models, based on Surface Evolver simulations of random soap froth with \{N3\} cells are constructed. In both cases the ligaments are straight but have nonuniform cross sectional area distributions that resemble those of the foams tested. The ligaments are modeled as shear deformable beams with elasto-plastic material behavior. The calculated compressive response starts with a linearly elastic regime. At higher stress levels, inelastic action causes a gradual reduction of the stiffness that eventually leads to a stress maximum, which represents the strength of the material. The periodicity of the Kelvin cell enables calculation of the compressive response up to the limit stress with just a single fully periodic characteristic cell. Beyond the limit stress, deformation localizes along the principal diagonals of the microstructure. Consequently beyond the limit stress the response is evaluated using finite size 3-D domains that allow the localization to develop. The random models consist of 3-D domains of 216, 512 or 1000 cells with periodicity conditions on the compressed ends but free on the sides. The compressive response is also characterized by a limit load instability but now the localization is disorganized resembling that observed in experiments. The foam elastic moduli and strengths obtained from both families of models are generally in very good agreement with the corresponding measurements. The random foam models yield 5–10 percent stiffer elastic moduli and slightly higher strengths than the Kelvin cell models. Necessary requirements for this high performance of the models are accurate representation of the material distribution in the ligaments and correct modeling of the nonlinear stress–strain response of the aluminum base material.

               PACKS simulates the very slow settling of rigid spheres (as in sedimentation) from a dilute suspen sion into a randomly packed bed. Spheres are intro duced one at a time in a potential field and fall or roll until they occupy one of the available sites. The position of an incoming sphere is calculated at each of the significant events in its history. Thus, probabilities for each site are assigned on a realis tic basis. Periodic boundary conditions eliminate wall effects (smooth walls induce partial ordering) and a rough floor reduces the disturbance at the bottom. These features make a greater proportion of simulated spheres truly random in final position and so available for analysis. A new search routine greatly reduces the time required to assemble a pack ing. Preservation of the addresses of supporting spheres simplifies the subsequent analysis for near est neighbors. Packings of 100 000 or more spheres are feasible. The simulation has potential applica tions in crystallography, soil engineering, biology, nuclear engineering, and petroleum engineering.

abstract ={The basic morphological unit of a closed cell rigid foam is the gas-filled cavity surrounded by cell walls and struts. Typically, these cavities (cells) are pentagonal dodecahedral or tetrakaidecahedral. Their average dimensions and dispersity are known to influence foam physical properties and foam performance. We have devised a reliable method for the measurement of cell-size and cell-size distribution which exploits both geometry and statistics, and which has allowed the realization of useful correlations and trends in our development of rigid foam formulations and additives.A thin slice of foam (100-300 microns) is subjected to optical microscopy and image analysis. Measurements of the areas of cell windows and of the average ferets of these windows are made independently. Windows are usually pentagonal, hexagonal or square and are variously distorted. Cells are assumed to be dodecahedral and cell diameter (d) is calculated by the formulae:

Cell-size distribution is quantified by measuring a large number (~ 500-1000) of windows and calculating the simple and weighted averages.This paper will present the mathematical basis for the method, illustrate the excellent agreement between the window area and the feret cell-size determinations and demonstrate the utility of cell-size and cell-size distribution data in physical property correlations, for example for k-factor.},

abstract ={The time to onset of cell opening and the modulus around the event were measured using a parallel-plate rheometer for flexible polyurethane foams. Cell opening time was compared with the visual blow-off time. The onset of cell opening occurs several seconds after phase separation, and the visual blow-off occurs several seconds (sometimes more than ten seconds) after the onset. Two series of formulations were studied, one in which the factors other than surfactant (tin catalyst level, TDI index, polyol type) were changed, and the second series in which only the surfactant was changed. In the first series, the modulus at cell opening did not change much with different formulations. However, the modulus development rate during the cell opening period (between the onset and the visual blow-off) changed significantly. Air flow was lower with higher modulus development rate. In the second series, the modulus development rate or the timing of onset of cell opening did not change even when the air flow changed considerably. The fact that the timing did not change and it is several seconds after the phase separation implies that the cell opening is triggered by sudden urea precipitation.Light interferometry showed that the average value of the remaining cell window thicknesses in low air flow foam is higher than that of the high air flow foam. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the final foam products showed that the cell windows are in a variety of stages. The windows were classified into four stages-fully open, partially open, pin holes and closed. Air flow is directly proportional to the effective fraction of open windows. SEM also showed that the cell windows are in several different states. Some window films were totally missing and others have left torn-off films. The possible mechanism of cell window rupture is discussed with respect to the results.},

abstract = "Abstract Stochastic equilibrium finite element (FE) foam models are used to study the influence of relative density and distribution of solid material between cell walls and edges on the elastic properties of foam materials. It is first established that the models contain a sufficient number of cells to ascertain isotropy and numerically and statistically robust results. It is then found that the elastic moduli are very weakly coupled to cell size variation in the models, when the latter is varied systematically. The influence from relative density and distribution of solid on the elastic parameters is considerably stronger. Analytical estimates from the literature, based on idealized cell models and dimension analysis, are matched by fitting coefficients to the \{FE\} results, providing good qualitative but relatively poor quantitative correlation. An expansion of the analytical coupling functions is then suggested in order to reduce their level of idealization. The expanded formulation shows virtually perfect agreement with the numerical results for almost the whole range of relative densities and distributions of solid in the \{FE\} parameter study. The presented analytical expression is believed to be general and provide accurate estimates of the elastic properties of a wide range of foam materials, provided that their bulk material properties and micro structure can be established.

The analysis is performed on a tetrakaidecahedral unit cell, which is centered at one lattice point of a body-centered cubic lattice and is subjected to compression on its two opposite square faces. The 36 struts of the unit cell are treated as uniform slender beams undergoing linearly elastic deformations, and the 24 vertices as rigid joints. All three deformation mechanisms of the cell struts (i.e., stretching, shearing and bending) possible under the specified loading are incorporated, and four different strut cross section shapes (i.e., circle, square, equilateral triangle and Plateau border) are treated in a unified manner in the present model, unlike in earlier models. Two closed-form formulas for determining the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of open-cell foams are provided. These two formulas are derived by using the composite homogenization theory and contain more parameters than those included in existing models. The new formulas explicitly show that the foam elastic properties depend on the relative foam density, the shape and size of the strut cross section, and the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the strut material. By applying the newly derived model directly, a parametric study is conducted for carbon foams, whose modeling motivated the present study. The predicted values of the effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio compare favorably with those based on existing models and experimental data. "

abstract ={The stiffness and strength properties of foams with tetrakaidecahedral unit cells are evaluated using both finite element-based micromechanics and analytical methods. The finite element analysis models the varying cross section of the struts exactly. The analytical methods assume the struts have constant cross section along the length. Equivalent constant cross section of the strut can be obtained by either matching the densities or by using harmonic averaging of the stiffness properties. A method in which the moment of inertia of the cross section is averaged is also considered. The comparison of properties obtained for the different equivalent constant cross-section foams shows the inability of the various averaging schemes to match the shear modulus and the strength properties, while the Young’s modulus matches to some extent. The failure of the weakest cross section in the varying cross-section strut of the unit cell leads to a lower tensile strength in the actual foam compared to the uniform cross-section foams. The results suggest that although the use of simple analytical models for foam properties are attractive, they often lead to erroneous results, and hence exact modeling of the strut geometry is key to estimating the stiffness and strength properties of foams and other cellular solids.},

The elastic stiffness of the model realizations is computed by micro finite element analysis using shell elements. The main result is a moderate decrease of the effective elastic stiffness for increasing cell size variations if the solid volume fraction is assumed to be constant. "

Three types of materials were studied: rigid spheres and spherical voids in an elastic matrix and a typical composite made up of glass spheres in an epoxy resin. The moduli obtained for different unit cells showed very little scatter, and the average values obtained from the analysis of four unit cells could be considered very close to the “exact” solution to the problem, in agreement with the results of Drugan and Willis (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 44 (1996) 497) referring to the size of the representative volume element for elastic composites.

The panel is fabricated by laminating two glass fiber-reinforced polymer skins to a prefabricated polyurethane foam core. Two different densities for the core are explored, namely; a 0.31 kN/m3, referred to herein as ‘soft’ foam, and a 0.63 kN/m3, referred to as ‘hard’ foam. Ten 1500 × 300 × 76 mm3 panels were tested in flexure. For each core density, three similar panels were tested to establish the reproducibility of test results as a measure of quality control of fabrication. The panels were tested in three-point and four-point bending as well as under uniform load. The effect of wind pressure and suction was simulated for some panels by applying cyclic bending. It was shown that flexural strength and stiffness increased substantially, by 165 percent and 113 percent, respectively, as the core density was doubled. The contributions of shear deformation of the soft and hard cores to mid-span deflection were 75% and 50%, respectively. Panels with soft cores were vulnerable to localized effects under concentrated loads, and suffered inwards wrinkling of the compression skin at a lower ultimate strength. Low cycle fatigue resulted in some residual deflection upon unloading but insignificant stiffness degradation.},

These equations are written as a function of the cell edge lengths and cross-section properties, the inclination angle and the strength and stiffness of the solid material. This micro-mechanics model employs an elongated Kelvin model geometry which is more general than that employed by previous authors, as the size and shape of the repeating unit cell are defined by specifying three independent dimensions. As a result, the model accounts for an additional variation in the unit cell shape which is not accounted for in the previous models. The effect of this additional shape parameter on the non-isotropic stiffness and strength behavior is demonstrated and the advantages of this more general micro-mechanics model are illustrated. "

If edge bending were the only mechanism the moduli would vary with the square of the foam density. The other deformation mechanisms are predicted to reduce the power law exponent by 3–5 percent, and the effect of edge torsion on the modulus level is small. The foam bulk modulus is predicted to vary linearly with its relative density, so Poisson's ratio approaches 0.5 at low densities. The lattice model is elastically isotropic, whereas other lattice models of foams are highly anisotropic."

abstract = "Cellular materials have large use in many components acting as impact energy absorbers. These components have to be designed on the basis of the kind of impact, of the involved energy amount and of the maximum admissible load. The choice of the most suitable density for the selected type of foam is based on stress–strain behaviour, obtained by means of experimental tests and/or models. Only a few micro-mechanical models, as the Gibson model, take into account the density effects. These models could result quite complex to manage because of the need of, at least, a rough analysis of the actual foam structure. Conversely, most of the models used for numerical simulations are phenomenological models and have simple parameter identification based on fitting of experimental data, but they do not account for density effect. Experimental uniaxial compression tests performed for several types of foams, namely EPP, \{PUR\} (Bayfill EA), \{EPS\} and PPO/PS (Noryl GTX), at different density levels are used in order to identify, with an optimisation procedure devoted to the minimisation of the fitting residual evaluated by the least square method, the parameters of four cellular solid models. The considered models are four: the Gibson model [Gibson LJ, Ashby MF. Cellular solids. Structure and properties. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1997], the Rusch model [Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of flexible foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1969;13:2297–311; Rusch KC. Energy-absorbing characteristics of foamed polymers. J Appl Polym Sci 1969;14:1133–47; Rusch KC. Load-compression behavior of brittle foams. J Appl Polym Sci 1970;14:1263–73], a modified version of the Gibson model and a new empirical model. The third and fourth models have been developed in order to better fit the experimental stress–strain curve. The obtained improvements in terms of weighted sum of the squared errors are shown. The experimental data are a good representation of the typical behaviour of these kinds of foams and can be useful for the validation of models and the comparison of their performance. Moreover the large basis of experimental data for different types of foams at different densities could be used for the analysis of the influence of the density on the model parameters. Explicit empirical formulations are proposed to express the dependency of the phenomenological model parameters on the foam density. These relationships permit the identification of whatever density foam derived from the same solid material and with the same micro-structure by means of a minimum set of experimental tests. At the same time the availability of a large quantity of experimental data is helpful to reach a higher level of confidence in the model parameter values. Finally the identified parameters vs. density laws for the considered types of foam could be used in order to assist the design of a given absorber and to find the optimum density for the specific application. Closed form expression for the specific energy W and the efficiency E can be obtained, based on the resulting identified phenomenological models. "

Using Laplace Transforms, we compare A and α to the parameters \{G0\} and β of the complex modulus G*(ω) = G0ωβ measured by other authors using magnetic twisting cytometry and atomic force microscopy. Excellent agreement between A and \{G0\} on the one hand, and between α and β on the other hand, indicated that the power-law is an intrinsic feature of cell mechanics and not the signature of a particular technique. Moreover, the agreement between measurements at very different size scales, going from a few tens of nanometers to the scale of the whole cell, suggests that self-similarity could be a central feature of cell mechanical structure. Finally, we show that the power-law behavior could explain previous results first interpreted as instantaneous elasticity. Thus, we think that the living cell must definitely be thought of as a material with a large and continuous distribution of relaxation time constants which cannot be described by models with a finite number of springs and dash-pots.

A cell volume distribution coefficient is introduced to modify the original Gibson-Ashby equations of effective mechanical properties of foam materials. The constants that influence the effective modulus are replaced by the coefficient. Based on the modified distribution coefficient, the yield stress is also recalculated. Using X-ray microtomography, the internal structures of different samples of polypropylene-nanoclay foam are obtained. The cell volume distributions of these samples are derived from the experiment by image analysis and the fitting curves are plotted. The distribution coefficient is acquired using the parameters from the theoretical model of the distribution curves. The results of the improved theory are compared with the experimental values and show good fitting quality. It was found that the precision of the improved theory is high and the cell volume distribution has an impact on the effective mechanical properties that would lead to the optimization of the synthesis procedure."

It is shown that the load–displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load.

A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique has been used to elucidate the defect formation mechanisms, as well as to determine their nature. A hybrid lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC)–finite element method (FEM) model fed by the outcome of \{MD\} was subsequently implemented. It scales up the simulation times and sizes, while reproducing the important features of the defected regrowth predicted previously. \{FEM\} calculations provide the strain pattern due to the density variation between the amorphous and crystalline phases, which is then taken into account by the \{LKMC\} model by including the effect of the strain in the rates of recrystallization. Overall, this multiscale modeling provides a physical explanation of the generation of defects and its relation with the presence of strain. The model also captures the character of formed defects. It distinguishes two types: twins formed at {1 1 1} planes and dislocations produced by the collapse of the two recrystallization fronts. Simulation results are validated by comparing them with significant experiments reported in the literature. "

The applicability and limitations of the novel approach are highlighted.

Previous work has assumed that the wall properties are constant for a wide range of different density foams and can be characterized by the properties of the unfoamed material. In this paper we show that, when considering extruded starch foams, variation of the extrusion parameters in order to produce different bulk density foams has an effect on the cell-wall material: notably upon the crystallinity,Tg and wall density. Therefore, both the bulk foam and cell-wall mechanical properties were measured in order to test the full theory. For the relative fracture stress, excellent agreement was found between the predicted power law behaviour and the experimental results. However, the power law for the relative modulus is larger than the predicted value.",

Because of the randomness and complexity of the microstructure of the carbon foam, representative cell ligaments were first characterized in detail at the microstructural level. The salient microstructural characteristics (or properties) were then correlated with the bulk properties through the present model. In order to implement the varying anisotropic nature of material properties in the foam ligaments, we made an attempt to use a finite element method to implement such variation along the ligaments as well as at a nodal point where the ligaments meet. The model was expected to provide a basis for establishing a process–property relationship and optimizing foam properties. The present model yielded a fairly reasonable prediction of the effective bulk properties of the foams. We observed that the effective elastic properties of the foams were dominated by the bending mode associated with shear deformation. The effective Young's modulus of the foam was strongly influenced by the ligament moduli, but was not influenced by the ligament Poisson's ratio. The effective Poisson's ratio of the foam was practically independent of the ligament Young's modulus, but dependent on the ligament Poisson's ratio. The effective Young's modulus of the carbon foam was dependent more on the transverse Young's modulus and the shear moduli of the foam ligaments, but less significantly on the ligament longitudinal Young's modulus. A parametric study indicated that the effective Young's modulus was significantly improved by increasing the solid modulus in the middle of the foam ligaments, but nearly invariant with that at the nodal point where the ligaments meet. Therefore, appropriate processing schemes toward improving the transverse and shear properties of the foam ligaments in the middle section of the ligaments rather than at the nodal points are highly desirable for enhancing the bulk moduli of the carbon foam.
